description: Apply the CHOP proposal — runs a pre-flight validation against the parent, allocates TRP into `CHOP.md` per side, then shells out to `naholo agent chopchop` which spawns the new OP, prunes the parent, posts a seed log, pushes, and cleans up. Run after `/chop` produces `notes/CHOP.md` and the user has reviewed it.

# Chopchop — Apply the CHOP

The second half of the OP-splitting workflow. `/chopchop` validates `notes/CHOP.md` against the parent's current `OPERATION.md`, allocates TRP into `CHOP.md` per side, and shells out to `naholo agent chopchop` — the CLI does every server call, file edit, push, and cleanup in one transactional pass. After `/chopchop`, the parent stays infiled in whatever phase it was already in; the new OP exists server-side only until someone runs `/exfil` on the parent and `/infil <newNumber>` in a fresh session.

This skill takes no freeform args — everything it needs is in `CHOP.md`. The user's editing pass on `CHOP.md` between `/chop` and `/chopchop` is the only customization channel.

## Arguments

None. `/chopchop` always consumes `{operationDir}/notes/CHOP.md` as-is. If the user wants to change the split, they edit `CHOP.md` before running `/chopchop`.

## What to do

### 1. Boot

**If you haven't run `naholo agent boot` in this session**, run it now via the Bash tool. Adopt `<personality>` as your voice (skip if empty), adopt `<manual>` rules, and cache **only `opPath`** from `<op_status>` as `{operationDir}` — the parent operation directory.

**If boot already ran this session**, run `naholo agent op` instead — treat its `<op_status>` payload as the current op status.

If `<op_status>` carries `No infiled operation.`, tell the user to run `/infil <opNum>` first and abort.

`<op_status>` carries `currentOp` / `opTitle` / `opNotes` — read from it whenever this skill needs them (`currentOp` / `opTitle` give the parent OP's `{parentNumber}` / `{parentTitle}`).

### 2. Load context

Read these now:

- `{operationDir}/notes/CHOP.md` — required. If missing, stop and tell the user to run `/chop "freeform"` first.
- `{operationDir}/notes/OPERATION.md` — re-read every invocation so manual mid-session edits land; needed for parity checks against the parent's MISSION/EXECUTION and for the TRP allocation in step 4
- `{operationDir}/TASKS.md` — needed for the shipped/unshipped state on parent tasks
- `{operationDir}/notes/TIMELINE.md` — **first session-boot only**; never re-read after that

### 3. Validate `CHOP.md` (abort-before-modify gate)

Before allocating TRP, before shelling out to the CLI, before any side effect: confirm `CHOP.md` is structurally sound and refers to real, unambiguous symbols on the parent. The CLI assumes these guarantees; failure here aborts cleanly without touching the server.

Build from `CHOP.md` (skip `## Intent` — it's a human-readable summary `/chop` writes for the user; `/chopchop` ignores it):

- The `# CURRENT OP #{n}: {title}` header (must parse), the `## SITUATION` / `### Pain` body, the `## MISSION` block (CONOPS + WO labels), and the `## EXECUTION` checklist. Each task item is `- [ ] TASK n — {title}` or `- [x] TASK n — {title}` — checkbox state encodes shipped (`[x]`) vs. unshipped (`[ ]`).
- The `# NEW OP: {newTitle}` header (must parse), the `## SITUATION` / `### Pain` body, the `## MISSION` block (CONOPS + WO labels), and the `## EXECUTION` checklist (renumbered 1..N, same checkbox semantics).

Then build four sets and one duplicate report:

- **Parent WO labels** — bold labels of every bullet in the parent's `OPERATION.md ## MISSION ### Warning Orders`.
- **CHOP WO labels** — bold labels in CHOP CURRENT OP `### Warning Orders` ∪ CHOP NEW OP `### Warning Orders`.
- **Parent task titles** — the `{title}` portion of every `### TASK n — {title}` heading in the parent's `## EXECUTION`.
- **CHOP task titles** — the text after `TASK n — ` on every checkbox item in CHOP CURRENT OP `## EXECUTION` ∪ CHOP NEW OP `## EXECUTION`. Checkbox state is informational and is **not** part of the symbol.
- **Duplicate titles** — any `{title}` that appears more than once across the parent's EXECUTION sections, or more than once across the combined CHOP EXECUTION checklists.

Validate, in this order. Any failure aborts before any modification — do not allocate TRP, do not run the CLI, do not call `add-timeline`:

1. **CURRENT OP header parses** — must be `# CURRENT OP #{n}: {title}` and `{n}` must equal `{parentNumber}`.
2. **NEW OP header parses** — must be `# NEW OP: {title}`.
3. **SITUATION presence** — both `# CURRENT OP` and `# NEW OP` blocks must contain a `## SITUATION` heading with a non-empty `### Pain` body. `### Notes` is optional. Pain/Notes bodies are free-form prose — no symbol-parity check.
4. **WO parity** — Parent WO labels set must equal CHOP WO labels set.
5. **Task parity** — Parent task titles set must equal CHOP task titles set.
6. **No duplicate task titles** — duplicates on either side make the apply-time parent→CHOP mapping ambiguous. Do not attempt source-order resolution; refuse.

TRP presence in `CHOP.md` is **not** validated — the next step regenerates it from scratch.

On any failure, collect every mismatch + duplicate report and print the abort report below as raw markdown (no surrounding fence) and stop. **Omit any sub-list whose items are empty**, and omit a parent section heading entirely when both of its sub-lists are empty:

> **CHOP is out of sync with OP #{parentNumber}.** Cannot apply.
>
> Header / SITUATION mismatch:
>
> - {one-line description per missing or malformed header, or per missing SITUATION/Pain block}
>
> Warning Orders mismatch:
>
> - In CHOP but not on parent:
>   - `{bold-label}`
>   - `{bold-label}`
> - On parent but not in CHOP:
>   - `{bold-label}`
>   - `{bold-label}`
>
> EXECUTION tasks mismatch:
>
> - In CHOP but not on parent:
>   - `TASK n — {title}`
>   - `TASK n — {title}`
> - On parent but not in CHOP:
>   - `TASK m — {title}`
>   - `TASK m — {title}`
> - Duplicate titles on parent (apply mapping ambiguous):
>   - `{title}` ({N} occurrences)
> - Duplicate titles in CHOP (apply mapping ambiguous):
>   - `{title}` ({M} occurrences)
>
> Run `/chop "freeform — bring CHOP back into sync with the parent's current MISSION/EXECUTION"` to refresh the proposal, then re-run `/chopchop`. (Alternatively, hand-edit [CHOP.md]({operationDir}/notes/CHOP.md) to match the parent.)

Common causes: `/warno` ran between `/chop` and `/chopchop` and added or dropped a WO; `/opord` cut new tasks or retitled existing ones; the user hand-edited `CHOP.md` and introduced a typo in a WO label or task title.

When validation passes, the parent↔CHOP mapping is unambiguous: every CHOP task title resolves to exactly one `### TASK m — {title}` section on the parent (by literal title match), and every WO bold label resolves to exactly one parent WO bullet. The CLI relies on that guarantee.

### 4. Allocate Target Reference Points into `CHOP.md`

Read the parent's `### Target Reference Points`. For each TRP entry, decide based on the carved vs. surviving WOs:

- **Supports only carved WOs** → write to NEW OP only.
- **Supports only surviving WOs** → write to CURRENT OP only.
- **Supports both** → write to both sides (duplicates are fine — TRP is a curated map, not a single-source-of-truth index).

This is a judgment call per entry; the user does not review the allocation. Lean toward duplication when in doubt — a TRP entry that's slightly out of scope on one side is cheap; a missing one is expensive.

Then **overwrite** the `### Target Reference Points` block under each side's `## MISSION` in `{operationDir}/notes/CHOP.md` with the allocated entries. Always rewrites — does **not** honor user hand-edits to existing TRP blocks. The user's TRP review channel is editing the parent's MISSION TRP before `/chopchop`, not editing TRP inside `CHOP.md`.

Format per entry follows the manual's TRP rules: backtick-wrapped paths, folder paths end with `/`, noun-only tags, no sub-bullets. Omit the `### Target Reference Points` heading entirely on a side when the side has zero entries (mirrors the `OPERATION.md` omit-when-empty convention).

### 5. Run `naholo agent chopchop`

Shell out via Bash:

```
naholo agent chopchop
```

The CLI consumes `CHOP.md` as the source of truth and performs the entire apply pass: creates the new OP server-side, seeds its `OPERATION.md` + tasks (verbatim from CHOP + parent EXECUTION sections), posts the seed log, patches the parent's `## SITUATION` / `## MISSION` / `## EXECUTION` in place, renames the parent server-side when the title differs, runs `pushOp` on the parent, deletes `CHOP.md` (server then local), and stamps a `chopchop` TIMELINE bullet. Exit code 0 on success; non-zero with a CliError message on stderr otherwise.

On non-zero exit, surface the CLI's stderr to the user verbatim and stop. The CLI leaves `CHOP.md` in place on failure so the user can retry.

On success, parse stdout as the result block — one `key: value` per line:

```
parentNumber: <int>
parentTitle: <string>
newNumber: <int>
newTitle: <string>
newUrl: <url>
movedWos: <int>
movedTasks: <int>
missionLine: <int or n/a>
parentOpState: mission-only | execution-ready | all-shipped
executionLine: <int or n/a>
nextTaskLine: <int or n/a>
nextTaskNumber: <int or n/a>
nextTaskTitle: <string or n/a>
```

The CLI computes the line anchors and the `parentOpState` itself — the skill does not re-read `OPERATION.md` / `TASKS.md` afterward.

### 6. Print summary

Print as raw markdown — no surrounding fence. Use markdown link syntax.

**Heading + result block** (always printed):

> CHOP applied on [OP #{parentNumber}: {parentTitle}]({operationDir}/notes/OPERATION.md)
>
> - Spawned: OP #{newNumber} {newTitle} — [open on Naholo]({newUrl})
> - Moved to new OP: {movedWos} Warning Orders, {movedTasks} task(s)

**Then append the next-actions block** that matches the `parentOpState` field from the CLI's result block.

`mission-only`:

> Next:
>
> - `/warno "freeform"` — adjust [MISSION]({operationDir}/notes/OPERATION.md#L{missionLine}) on the parent.
> - `/opord` — cut the parent [MISSION]({operationDir}/notes/OPERATION.md#L{missionLine}) into EXECUTION tasks.

`execution-ready`:

> Next:
>
> - `/opord "freeform"` — revise the parent's [EXECUTION]({operationDir}/notes/OPERATION.md#L{executionLine}) (insert / drop / rewrite unfinished tasks).
> - `/splash` — ship [TASK {nextTaskNumber} — {nextTaskTitle}]({operationDir}/notes/OPERATION.md#L{nextTaskLine})

`all-shipped`:

> Next:
>
> - `/exfil` — every task on the parent is shipped; sync and close out the operation.

For `all-shipped`, do not append `/warno`, `/opord`, `/splash`, `/sitrep`, or any other skill — just the single `/exfil` bullet. For `mission-only` and `execution-ready`, the listed bullets are the only next-step pointers; do not invent additional options.

Substitute `{missionLine}`, `{executionLine}`, `{nextTaskLine}`, `{nextTaskNumber}`, `{nextTaskTitle}` directly from the CLI result block. When a field's value is `n/a`, the next-actions variant that would have used it does not apply (the `parentOpState` field already selected the correct variant).

## Post-chopchop phase

`/chopchop` **ends the chop phase**. No new phase begins automatically — the next phase is the user's choice, picked by invoking the appropriate skill. Do not infer a phase from `OPERATION.md` state and act as if it had been entered.

If the user asks for follow-up work on the parent without explicitly invoking a skill, **push back once**. Surface the skill that owns the work — picking the most plausible suggestion from the prompt, or from the `parentOpState` value the CLI returned in step 5 if the prompt is ambiguous — and wait for them to invoke it. Common mappings:

- Rewriting parent `## MISSION` → suggest `/warno "..."`
- Cutting tasks / editing parent `## EXECUTION` or `TASKS.md` → suggest `/opord "..."`
- Implementing a parent task → suggest `/splash {N}`
- Drafting another split → suggest `/chop "..."` (the chop phase has ended; `CHOP.md` is gone)
- Pushing the parent's pruned state → suggest `/sitrep` (checkpoint) or `/exfil` (final)
- Working on the spawned OP → suggest `/exfil` parent first, then `/infil {newNumber}` in a fresh session

If the user pushes back, rephrases the request, or otherwise signals they want the work done without invoking the suggested skill, **treat that as an explicit override and do the work directly**. The one-time push-back is a check, not a wall — the escape hatch stays open till the next skill invocation.

## Rules

- **`CHOP.md` is mandatory** — if it doesn't exist, stop and point the user at `/chop`. `/chopchop` cannot improvise a split from freeform args.
- **No freeform args** — the only customization channel between `/chop` and `/chopchop` is hand-editing `CHOP.md`.
- **TRP allocation is regenerated on every `/chopchop` run** — user hand-edits to TRP blocks in `CHOP.md` are not preserved. The user's TRP review channel is editing the parent's MISSION TRP before `/chopchop`.
- **Trust `CHOP.md` on shipped scope** — if it lists a shipped task under `# NEW OP`, the CLI carries the task with its AAR intact. The shipped-or-not decision is `/chop`'s gate, not `/chopchop`'s.
- **CLI owns apply semantics** — verbatim WO / task-section transfer, no-renumbering on the parent, new-OP renumber-from-1, server-then-local CHOP delete, and the parent rename are all CLI responsibilities. The skill validates and shells out; it does not edit `OPERATION.md`, `TASKS.md`, or call MCP tools.
- **Always use absolute filesystem paths in link targets** — substitute `{operationDir}` literally with `opPath` from boot's `<op_status>`.
- Print the summary as raw markdown — no surrounding fence.
